# Cube-Computer
Created Schematics to a Computer with its own language to control a cube printed onto a 2D screen. This was done using Logism a software that allows to create a more visual and interactive representation of the schematic. My schematic intakes a binary file and reads it to manipulate a cube using a rudementary CPU and GPU made from scratch.
